# SpotifyAPI DRA22

Collective project where the knowledge acquired in the subject will be put into practice, taking as an example Spotify API to query data about albums, artists, tracks, etcâ€¦ - Rapid Application Development 2022 UAL

## Architecture

This project's frontend is built using Angular from where the request to the [API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) are made. The backend is built using Spring Boot which communicate with the PostgreSQL data base.

In the data base we only save the Track id, the same id that the API use:

To communicate front with back, we used HTTP requests to the created endpoints of the backend:

### Get

It returns the list of all the Tracks that the data base have.

### Get(id: String)

It returns a Track by its id.

### Post(track: Track)

It saves the track in the data base.

### Delete(id: String)

It removes a track from the data base by its id.

Using the same backend, we have a endpoint to return the events of the year in Spain.
